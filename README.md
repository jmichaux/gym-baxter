# Robotics Control Environments
`ripl-control` provides a common interface for performing reinforcement learning and control experiments on [RIPL](http://www.ttic.edu/ripl/) robots in simulation and on real hardware. `ripl-control` uses PyBullet as the backend for simulation experiments and ROS as the backend for hardware experiments. `ripl-control` also utilizes the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) paradigm that is common for reinforcement learning environments.
